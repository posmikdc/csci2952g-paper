In this review, we present some of the key experiments that have introduced major conceptual advances in biochemistry and molecular biology, and review technological breakthroughs that have paved the way for today's systems-wide approaches to protein–protein interaction analysis.},

abstract = {Summary
The identification of individual protein-protein interactions (PPIs) began more than 40 years ago, using protein affinity chromatography and antibody co-immunoprecipitation. As new technologies emerged, analysis of PPIs increased to a genome-wide scale with the introduction of intracellular tagging methods, affinity purification (AP) followed by mass spectrometry (MS), and co-fractionation MS (CF-MS). Now, combining the resulting catalogs of interactions with complementary methods, including crosslinking MS (XL-MS) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), helps distinguish direct interactions from indirect ones within the same or between different protein complexes. These powerful approaches and the promise of artificial intelligence applications like AlphaFold herald a future where PPIs and protein complexes, including energy-driven protein machines, will be understood in exquisite detail, unlocking new insights in the contexts of both basic biology and disease.}

abstract = {Protein-protein interaction plays key role in predicting the protein function of target protein and drug ability of molecules. The majority of genes and proteins realize resulting phenotype functions as a set of interactions. The in vitro and in vivo methods like affinity purification, Y2H (yeast 2 hybrid), TAP (tandem affinity purification), and so forth have their own limitations like cost, time, and so forth, and the resultant data sets are noisy and have more false positives to annotate the function of drug molecules. Thus, in silico methods which include sequence-based approaches, structure-based approaches, chromosome proximity, gene fusion, in silico 2 hybrid, phylogenetic tree, phylogenetic profile, and gene expression-based approaches were developed. Elucidation of protein interaction networks also contributes greatly to the analysis of signal transduction pathways. Recent developments have also led to the construction of networks having all the protein-protein interactions using computational methods for signaling pathways and protein complex identification in specific diseases.},

  abstract  = "As genomics advances reveal the cancer gene landscape, a
               daunting task is to understand how these genes contribute to
               dysregulated oncogenic pathways. Integration of cancer genes
               into networks offers opportunities to reveal protein-protein
               interactions (PPIs) with functional and therapeutic
               significance. Here, we report the generation of a cancer-focused
               PPI network, termed OncoPPi, and identification of >260
               cancer-associated PPIs not in other large-scale interactomes.
               PPI hubs reveal new regulatory mechanisms for cancer genes like
               MYC, STK11, RASSF1 and CDK4. As example, the NSD3 (WHSC1L1)-MYC
               interaction suggests a new mechanism for NSD3/BRD4 chromatin
               complex regulation of MYC-driven tumours. Association of
               undruggable tumour suppressors with drug targets informs
               therapeutic options. Based on OncoPPi-derived STK11-CDK4
               connectivity, we observe enhanced sensitivity of STK11-silenced
               lung cancer cells to the FDA-approved CDK4 inhibitor
               palbociclib. OncoPPi is a focused PPI resource that links cancer
