abstract = {Predicting protein stability change upon variation through a computational approach is a valuable tool to unveil the mechanisms of mutation-induced drug failure and develop immunotherapy strategies. Some previous machine learning-based techniques exhibit anti-symmetric bias toward destabilizing situations, whereas others struggle with generalization to unseen examples. To address these issues, we propose a gated graph neural network-based approach to predict changes in protein stability upon mutation. The model uses message passing to encode the links between the molecular structure and property after eliminating the non-mutant structure and creating input feature vectors. While doing so, it also incorporates the coordinates of the raw atoms to provide spatial insights into the chemical systems. We test the model on the Ssym, Myoglobin, Broom, and p53 datasets to demonstrate the generalization performance. Compared to existing approaches, our proposed method achieves improved linearity with symmetry in less time. The code for this study is available at: https://github.com/HongzhouTang/Pros-GNN.}
